This is almost a complete app built entirely by Albert Yakubov(myself)

The app consists of recycler view that displays the genres
Options menu displaying the details for each genre 

multiple UI bugs, no big deal at the moment

Great app to experiment with:
like adding pictures for each genre (in the recycler view)
also adding more genres.
So far even with bugs, I got beautiful UI
